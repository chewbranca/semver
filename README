# lein-semver

This lein plugin is a little experiment with more active enforcement
of [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) with lein projects.

Currently this plugin will add a git pre-commit hook to your project
that will block you from committing anything new without also
modifying the version in your project.clj.

## Usage

   git clone git://github.com/chewbranca/semver.git
   lein install
   lein plugin install lein-semver 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT

Now switch to your project and run

    lein semver

This will initialize the semver git hook into your project.
